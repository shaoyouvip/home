> This project was originally just a simple homepage. However, as more and more friends discovered this project, it received a lot of undue attention. Moreover, as a work of a beginner in front-end development, its code is quite messy and of low quality. In addition, this project has also been resold by many unknown resource or download sites, causing many unsuspecting buyers to find my contact information from the source code to consult on problems or request features. But due to current personal life reasons, and I have never gained any benefits from this project, so I am unable to maintain this project. This repository will not be archived. We will actively accept PRs from all the experts, but no updates will be made for any new features or bugs. Please understand!

<strong><h2>Homepage</h2></strong>

<summary>old way</summary>

>As Chinese fonts are introduced in this project, Chinese fonts need to be compressed to improve the loading speed of the page (you can also cancel the use of Chinese fonts)

#### Chinese font removal traditional

- Install `Python 3.7` and `pip`
- Run `pip install fonttools`
- Download [sc_unicode.txt](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/imaegoo/d64e5088b723c2e02c40985f55ff12db/raw/5ebd2ce49418c73459a9dfe050483409306a6c1d/sc_unicode.txt)
- Run `pyftsubset font-name.ttf --unicodes-file=sc_unicode.txt`

#### fonts further compressed

- Compile and install ``Google woff2``

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y git g++ make
git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/woff2.git
cd woff2
make clean all
```

- Compress the font again

```
. /woff2_compress . /font_name.ttf
```

- Eventually the original font can be slow loaded, **load the compressed font first**
